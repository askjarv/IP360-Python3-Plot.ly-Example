Tripwire IP360 API Example- Using Python 3 and Plot.ly to visualise data

After my recent post over on the State of Security blog I wanted to share just how easy it is to get started with a few basic scripts to capture and present information from Tripwire's IP360 VnE. 

The following is a technical walk-through intended to take you through the process of connecting to Tripwireâ€™s Vulnerability and Exposure (VnE) virtual appliance API using Python, capturing vulnerability scanning data and then outputting it graphically using a public service called plot.ly using a second API. Despite us using two different API's the code - available 

I'll assume you've got some basics of programming and/or scripting already in your head, but this is very much a beginner's example, so I'll try to detail anything that might catch you out.
